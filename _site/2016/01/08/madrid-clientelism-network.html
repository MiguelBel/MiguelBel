<h2 class="post-title">How Major of Madrid is trying to end up with the clientelism network</h2>
<h3 id="how-governance-policies-works-in-madrid-spain-and-the-world-in-general">How governance policies works in Madrid, Spain and the world in general</h3>

<p>Long, long time ago, there was a small village, not too many people living there. Let’s say we have a dominant class conformed by 10% of the population all of them wealthy. They are not supposed to have more rights and legally they do not have.</p>

<p>Since they can afford better education is not surprise for anyone that they will get the best political positions. This well-off class is not inherently bad and they relatively want the best for the people, but putting their interest first.</p>

<p>They have their private business but this private business frequently get benefited by the expenses of public institutions. They get contracts and the influences.</p>

<p>It is neither a surprise that, from hegemonic power given by a rotary democracy, the governance policies became a clientelism network without being a <em>de facto</em> kleptocracy.</p>

<p>And the time comes and goes and other people enter in this restricted wealthy class and some other go out.</p>

<p>They do not have more rights but they have more rights. Public institutions consider that deals and treatment of this class is of public interest due to the benefit of the whole society. Their companies give job to local people and provide a -better or worse- service to society. If you analyze the situation you see how this relationship with the public administration wind up in a entry barrier for the rest of the non-caste competitors and also a lose of competitiveness due to the bribery and corruption.</p>

<h3 id="an-example-of-how-madrid-was-feeding-their-clientelism-network">An example of how Madrid was feeding their clientelism network</h3>

<p>Now, in these days, there is a big city, capital of a great country. Madrid. In Madrid we have a dominant class which extensively with other wealthy classes of other cities in Spain enjoy of the favor of Spanish public institutions the ones that they rule.</p>

<p>In Madrid every year, the 5th of January there is a parade due to a Spanish tradition. In that parade there was a VIP zone in which only the chosen by the city hall are allowed to go.</p>

<p>Every year the wealthy people of the city end up going to that VIP zone for not “mix with the ordinary people”.</p>

<p>It is not a big deal, it do not cost too much money but it exemplifies the inequality.</p>

<p>Madrid is currently the city with the most quantity of debt per inhabitant of Spain. Every Madrid citizen owes more than 2.000€ and we are talking of 3 million.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BZmUR3X.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>Ahora Madrid (a local brand of national party, Podemos) used to repeat a lot the term “Illegitimate debt” to refer to the debts that is not going to be paid since it served the interest of particulars and not of the citizens.</p>

<p>”Illegitimate debt” is, in terms of idealistic world, improbable and totally undesirable since it breaks the legal protection. But we should ask ourselves why certain people or certain companies are receiving, systematically, our money. We should ask for more transparency and we should ask for a truly equality of opportunities in doing business with public institutions.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-major-of-madrid-did-a-first-step-to-stop-it">How the Major of Madrid did a first step to stop it</h3>

<p>Last year the government changed to one more leftie and with more “common sense”. This post is not about left or right is about equality and ethics.</p>

<p>The major, Manuela Carmena has been criticized a lot for her measures. I do, I criticized her sometimes but today is not the time.</p>

<p>She turned the VIP zone in a place for disabled people. And this is a first step to say to every people who mix their private business with the public ones to stay away.</p>

<p>This is a first step to stop to use public relations as an excuse of use public money in benefiting only to some. She is also doing some other things for prevent that. Time will say if she became a truly changer or if she follow the same attitude as her predecessors.</p>
